Objective: Run a simple web server on a device and view a web page using the http protocol 

1) Obtain the Raspberry Pi kit assembled the previous week. Connect it to power, monitor, mouse and keyboard.
2) Use the text editor to create a simple web page named index.html including the student’s name in the title and a positive statement about them in the body of the page.
3) Use a browser to view the web page using a file URL.
4) Connect to Ethernet if available at the desk, otherwise a mentor will help connect the device to wifi.
5) Open a terminal and change the current working directory to the directory where the web page is saved. Start a web server using a Python one-liner in a terminal:
	  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
6) View the same web page using http from the local device.
7) Determine your device’s IP address and share it with another student. View each other’s pages in a browser.
8) Bonus: if extra time is available, add hyperlinks to the web page to create a web ring with two or more other devices.

For students who have not completed setting up their Raspberry Pi - have them sit on one side of the room and one mentor will help them complete it. They can start the exercise if time allows.
